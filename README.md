# Predictive Analysis on Power Outages
Project for DSC 80 at UC San Diego
By Ken Ogihara

## Introduction
In this project, I analyze a dataset that includes major power outages across the U.S from 2000-2016. This dataset is from Purdue University's Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure. This data contains information on the geographical location of the outages, climactic data, and electricity consumption patterns and economic characteristics of the states affected by the outages. 

I will first perform basic exploratory data analysis, assess missingness dependency, and finally build a model that predicts whether a power outage is caused by the weather or an intentional attack. This is valuable important for the Department of Education and private energy companies because
